Hello my name is Seth Chouinard. 

That sounds like a start to a business email. Anyway!

In the repository is what I believe to be all the neccessary files needed to get this form working. 
I am going to be uploading the ORIGINAL php files as I have made changes to them which have most likley messed things up.

The Domain Registar is currently www.domain.com. I also have my email going through their servers.
However it actually is just a forward to a gmail that I use.

The file hosting is with GoDaddy.com.

What ever information you need in regards to the domain.com or godaddy servers will be attatched to this document.
If there is something else that I did not include you can email me at seth@portalnetworking.net
FYI That is the email that I would like to have the form forward to. 


I was considering using 123 contact forms in an IFRAME but I could not design it as much as I would have like to fit the theme.
So I am determined to get this to work even though PHP is German to me.

Bascially it is not that something specific is not working it is more of the fact that I do not know how to get it working.

So:
contact-2-recaptcha.html is that mail html file for the form.

Email to which the info will go = seth@portalnetworking.net
Password = Chouinard (this is just my lastname. After I can find this in the code and change it to my real password.)
POP3 Server = imap.domain.com          Port = 143
IMAP 
Incoming mail server = imap.domain.com  Port = 143
Outgoing mail server = smtp.domain.com  Port = 587
SSL/TLS = No

If you have any question you should already have my email. haha. If you would like me to upload new code I can do that. 

If you would like to see a live version of this go to www.portalnetworking.net/test/contact-2-recaptcha.html

There is currently no recaptcha. I do not know how difficult it is but if it is easy I can get you the recaptcha secret.
